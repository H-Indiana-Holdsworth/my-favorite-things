    <p>
        This is my blue knife. I just got it. It is an automatic opener so all that you have to do is press a button to open it. 
        It is made by Pro-tech, a good company. I decided to use Pro-tech because I've been looking for an upgrade for a while and know that their build quality is really good. 
        I'm an avid knife user and lover, I've been that way for as long as I can remember and this is one of my favorite knives.
